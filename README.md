## Description

Take a look at my very first deployed web application built without a starter code. This presented several challenges but awarded me the opportunity to understanding CSS in more indepth. Flexbox and responsive design layouts were huge challenges for me that I was not able to fully execute. However, I do plan to continue improving this site as I gain more knowledge and skill in working with CSS.
